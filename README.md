# 📊 MySQL Practice

Welcome to my SQL practice repository! This project is built around a fictional **Parks and Recreation** employee database and may more data base and is inspired by my desire to master SQL for real-world applications, placements, and interviews.

---

## 🎯 Motive

As a passionate engineering student aiming for roles in data analytics, backend, and systems development, I created this repo to track and showcase my MySQL learning journey. I'm building consistent habits and documenting everything as I go.

---

## 📌 Objectives

* Build a strong foundation in MySQL
* Understand data querying from beginner to intermediate level
* Prepare confidently for placement tests and interviews
* Practice on real-world-style datasets
* Track daily learning and progress across different databases

---

## 🚀 Learning & Implementation Strategy

I'm following a **day-wise progress model**, organizing my files as `day01.sql`, `day02.sql`, and so on. This structure keeps my practice modular and easier to manage, especially as I work with multiple databases in the future.
More files will be added as I continue to learn and explore other databases.

---

## 📁 Repository Structure

* `day01.sql`, `day02.sql`, etc. – Daily SQL practice files
* `Parks_and_Recreation_schema.sql` – Database schema and sample data
* `README.md` – Project overview (you are here!)

## 📚 Learning Resource

This journey is based on the amazing [Alex The Analyst](https://www.youtube.com/c/AlexTheAnalyst)'s SQL tutorial series on YouTube. A huge shoutout to him for making SQL simple and enjoyable!
